Health and adrenaline are the only things to keep up with players.

Status bar fixes:
- Remove the yellow bar.
- The red bubble should be the rage.
- The blue bar should be the health.
	- Taking damage takes away a bar.

Make a new project to start making Gareth's move-set work and create a generic as F#@$ template platforming map. Do the starts and gets overtime stuff and upload it to Itch as a browser game to have Stanlee play-test and use it for map design and character art.

Starts:
	- walking ✅
	- single jump ✅
	- dash (basic) ✅
		- small enemies stun when dashed
		- bigger enemies stun you when dashed
		- cannot dash more than once in the air.✅
		- second delay before next dash✅
	- basic up, down, left, right attacks.✅
		- down attacking enemies can make you pogo off of them.✅
		- combos do more damage.✅
		- charged attacks do lots of damage.✅
Gets over time:
	- double jump
	- charged dash/burrow
	- wall jump
	- second wind (second life type thing)
	- go through the background layer to interact in the background

Upgrades:
	- upgrade health (starts with 5 bars of health)
	-  dash upgrades (how many times you can dash in the air)
	- rage upgrades (how long it lasts)
	- health items (stores however many items you have.)
	- talismans/charm type thing (not an upgrade but benefits the player)
