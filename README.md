Make a new project to start making Gareth's move-set work and create a generic as F#@$ template platforming map. Do the starts and gets overtime stuff and upload it to Itch as a browser game to have Stanlee play-test and use it for map design and character art.

Starts:
	- walking ✅
	- single jump ✅
	- dash (basic) ✅
		- Can dash when standing still ✅
		- small enemies stun when dashed✅
		- Bigger enemies that are not bosses stun when charged dashed✅
		- Bigger enemies that are not bosses will stun you when not charged dashed✅
		- cannot dash more than once in the air.✅
		- second delay before next dash✅
	- basic up, down, left, right attacks.✅
		- Down-attacking enemies can make you pogo off of them.✅
		- Combos do more damage.✅
		- Charged attacks do lots of damage.✅
	- Is still able to jump if they haven't jumped yet but are falling✅
Gets over time:
	- Double jump✅
	- Charged dash✅
	- Wall jump✅
	- Go through the background layer to interact in the background✅
		- Goes through orange walls when dashing, and with this enabled
	- Second wind (second life type thing)✅
		- When they die and revive, health lowers until enemies or players die

Upgrades (do this once approved and discussed on how the enhancements look):
	- Upgrade health (starts with 5 bars of health)
	- Dash upgrades (how many times you can dash in the air)
	- Rage upgrades (how long it lasts)
	- Health items (stores however many items you have)
	- Talismans/charm type thing (not an upgrade but benefits the player, maybe they could be how the user does the "gets over time"...)
